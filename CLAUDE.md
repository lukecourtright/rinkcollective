# CLAUDE.md

## Running the App

```bash
# Windows (opens browser automatically)
run.bat

# Direct
python -m uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload
```

App serves at `http://localhost:8000`. No build step needed.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployment

Live at `https://barnandbiscuit-production.up.railway.app`. GitHub repo: `github.com/lukecourtright/barnandbiscuit`. Deploys to Railway via `railway.toml`, auto-deploying on push to `main`. The Postgres addon is linked to the web service.

`DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string, auto-injected by the Railway Postgres addon. Not required locally: if unset, the app falls back to a local `dev.db` SQLite file (gitignored).

`SECRET_KEY` — signs the session cookie used for login, set as a Railway env var. Not required locally: falls back to an insecure dev default if unset.

## Brand Name

The brand name is TBD — "HockeyLifers" domain was taken, "Barn & Biscuit" is the current placeholder. To rename:
1. Change `this.BRAND = 'Barn & Biscuit'` near the top of `static/index.html`
2. Update `<title>` in the same file
3. That's it — all wordmark rendering derives from `this.BRAND`

### Backend (`main.py`)

Data is stored in a database (Postgres in production via Railway addon, local SQLite fallback otherwise) accessed through SQLModel. `rinks.json` remains the human/AI-edited source of truth — on every startup, `sync_rinks_from_file()` creates tables if missing, upserts (by `id`) every rink from `rinks.json` into the `Rink` table, and deletes any `Rink` row whose `id` is no longer in the file, so pushing an updated `rinks.json` to `main` (additions, edits, *and* removals) is enough to update production data on the next deploy.

- `GET /` → serves `static/index.html`
- `GET /api/rinks` → queries the `Rink` table, returns all rows as JSON (same shape as before)
- `POST /api/rinks/submit` → inserts community-submitted rinks into the `PendingRink` table (`id`, `submittedAt`, raw `data` JSON blob) — not public until moderated, no validation yet
- `POST /api/auth/signup`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/me` → email/password auth against the `User` table (`id`, `email`, `passwordHash` (bcrypt), `displayName`, `createdAt`). Login state is a signed, httponly session cookie (Starlette `SessionMiddleware`, see `SECRET_KEY` above) holding `user_id` — no tokens handled in JS.
- `/static` → static file mount for CSS, logos, etc.

### Frontend (`static/index.html`)

Vanilla JS SPA — no bundler, no framework.

**`RinkFinder` class** manages all state and rendering:
- `this.rinks` — fetched from `/api/rinks` on init
- `this.state` — single state object (search, filters, selectedRinkId, drawerOpen, activeTab, locationStatus, mobileView, checkinsById, currentUser, showAuth, authMode, etc.)
- `setState(partial | fn)` — merges partial state and calls `render(prev)`
- `render(prev)` — diffs against prev state, updates the DOM in targeted sections

**Three dynamic render sections** (rebuilt via `innerHTML` on change):
- `#rink-list` + `#mobile-rink-list` — rink cards, rebuilt on filter/search/selection changes
- `#drawer-body` — Info/Events/Reviews tab content, rebuilt on selection/tab/checkin changes
- Modals — toggled via `display` on `showReport`/`showAddRink`/`showAuth` state. The auth modal doubles as sign-in/sign-up, switching via `authMode` (`updateAuthUI()` toggles the display-name field, title, and error text)

**All other DOM updates** (location label, toggle state, filter chip active class, distance label, count) are targeted property sets, not full re-renders.

**Map** (Leaflet.js 1.9.4 + CartoDB Dark Matter tiles, free, no API key):
- Custom teardrop `divIcon` pins: cyan default, gold when selected
- `updateMarkers()` called on filter/search/selection changes — adds/removes markers from the map to match the filtered list
- `map.invalidateSize()` called after drawer opens/closes so Leaflet redraws to the new viewport width
- `map.panTo()` called when a rink is selected

**Geolocation flow:**
1. `requestLocation()` called on init and on nav button click
2. On grant: flies to user coords, zoom 10, adds cyan circle marker, sorts by distance
3. On deny: "Location Off" label, distance filter/sort gracefully hidden

**`openNow`** is computed dynamically in the browser from `hours[day]` + current local time — not stored in `rinks.json`.

**Responsive breakpoint:** 768px
- Below: sidebar hidden, nav links hidden, floating Map/List toggle, full-screen list overlay (`#mobile-list`)
- Above: 355px sidebar, 400px detail drawer

### Data (`rinks.json`)

Source of truth for rink data — edit by hand to add/remove/update. Synced into the `Rink` table (Postgres/SQLite, see Backend above) on every app startup: rows are upserted by `id`, and any DB row whose `id` is no longer present in `rinks.json` is deleted, so removals in the file propagate too. `openNow` is not stored — it's derived at runtime in the browser.

**Current count:** ~49 rinks (15 original seeds, 4 West Coast NHL facilities, 30 IL/WI batch added 2026-06-30).

**Bulk import workflow:**
1. Copy `rinks_import_template.csv`, fill in one region's worth of rinks, save as a new file.
2. Run `python scripts/import_rinks_csv.py path/to/batch.csv` — appends to `rinks.json` with sequential `id`s.
3. Push `rinks.json` to `main` → Railway auto-deploys and syncs to Postgres on startup.

**CSV field notes (learned from IL/WI batch):**
- `type` — use `NHL`, `OLYMPIC`, `SYNTHETIC`, or `STANDARD`. `Indoor` also accepted (maps to `STANDARD`). Use `OLYMPIC` for rinks that explicitly have an Olympic-size (200×100 ft) sheet.
- `amenities` — comma-separated or semicolon-separated, both work (auto-detected).
- `website` — `https://` and `http://` prefixes are stripped automatically.
- `hours_*` — use `"Varies"` when hours change seasonally/weekly (stored as-is and displayed). Leave blank to default to `"Call for hours"`.
- `events`/`reviews`/`rating`/`reviewCount`/`checkins` — not in the CSV. Rating/counts get randomized illustrative placeholders; events/reviews start empty.

**Schema** (mirrors the `Rink` SQLModel in `main.py` field-for-field — `hours`/`amenities`/`events`/`reviews` are stored as JSON columns, everything else as real columns):
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Rink Name",
  "address": "123 Ice Ln",
  "city": "Boston",
  "state": "MA",
  "lat": 42.35,
  "lng": -71.15,
  "type": "NHL",           // "NHL" | "OLYMPIC" | "SYNTHETIC" | "STANDARD"

}
```

### Brand System (`static/brand-tokens.css`, `static/logo/`)

- Copied from `C:\Users\lukec\Desktop\SpendTools\design_handoff_brand_system\` — do not edit in place; re-copy from source if the design system is updated
- Dark theme activated by `<html data-theme="dark">` on the root element
- All colors in `index.html` use `var(--token-name)` from this file
- Key tokens: `--bg` (#0A0E1A), `--surface` (#131A2B), `--surface-2` (#1C2540), `--border` (#2A3450), `--color-primary` (cyan #14CFCF), `--font-display` (Space Grotesk), `--font-body` (Hanken Grotesk), `--font-mono` (Space Mono)

## Not Yet Implemented

- Google Places API integration (rink data currently curated by hand in `rinks.json`)
- Admin UI for moderating community-submitted rinks (sit in the `PendingRink` table, unvalidated) — accounts now exist, so this can gate on an `isAdmin`-style check when built
- Server-persisted check-ins and reviews (session-only in v1) — accounts now exist to attribute these to, but check-ins/reviews still aren't wired to the `User` table
- Schema migrations (tables are created via `SQLModel.metadata.create_all()`, no Alembic yet)
- Rink photo carousels
- Community and News sections (nav links present but inactive)
- "Submit an Event" and "Write a Review" buttons (UI only, no backend)
